            <p> Due to a combination of technical and political reasons, we are switching away from using google login to only using 
                elixir login. We hope that this isn't a problem for anyone, but we understand that some people have been using google 
                to log in in the past. If this is the case, use the google login link below to transfer your access permissions to 
                your elixir account. If you don't have any current access permissions, just use the elixir login and you will never 
                have any trouble with this transfer!
