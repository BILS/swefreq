Merge accounts for Elixir AAI
=============================

It is possible to maintain the same dataset permissions with other logins (e.g. you are a dataset admin with your institutional account and want to be able to login with your ORCID account and still be an admin).

To merge the accounts:

1. Log in to the Perun Identity consolidator at https://perun.elixir-czech.cz/fed/gui with your account with admin access.
2. Go to the authentication tab and click `identity consolidator >>`.
3. Log in with your second account.
